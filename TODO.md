# Packaging

This plugin should not only be packaged as as QGIS plugin but also stand-alone as wheel and conda package. How does a reasonable project / directory structure look like?

# Testing

## `dtype_version_class`

- test run against plugin database while comparing against `python/pyplugin_installer/version_compare.py`
- fuzzing

Are commas valid version element delimiters?
